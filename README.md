### the official repository for people who had better things to do (but didn't do them)

welcome to **scrotiegg** — the first crypto project not made to change the world, but to remind you how little you can actually achieve.

## what is this?

a coin, a philosophy, a lifestyle… or just an egg with hair.  
it’s up to you (but don’t expect too much).

## why?

because success is overrated.  
because losing with style is better than winning by accident.  
because someone, somewhere, had to create the lowest standard.  
you’re welcome.

## how does it work?

- launch coin  
- watch people buy  
- watch people regret  
- everyone loses  
- nobody learns

## features

- meme potential: unlimited  
- financial upside: questionable  
- roadmap: whatever  
- utility: pending  
- inspiration: none

## join us

if you’re tired of dreams and want something more realistic (like disappointment),  
follow us everywhere @scrotiegg

## warning

this repo contains traces of hope.  
if symptoms of ambition appear, consult a quitter immediately.

made with minimal effort by people who should’ve known better.
