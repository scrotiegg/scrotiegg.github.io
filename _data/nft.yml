      why? because there are no artists here. not even talented people.  
      even if there were, we’d still be too lazy to ask for help.

      the **scrotiegg nft collection** is living proof that **art is overrated** and **effort is optional**.

      utility? zero.  
      originality? questionable.  
      shame? guaranteed.
