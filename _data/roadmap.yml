      **Q1 – delay.**  
      we had plans. then we forgot them.  

      **Q2 – regret.**  
      we launched something. probably shouldn’t have.  

      **Q3 – chaos.**  
      everything's on fire. we’re just watching.  

      **Q4 – probably nothing.**  
      big things might happen. but they won’t.

      **Q∞ – loop of failure.**  
      nothing ends. nothing improves. just vibes and losses.
