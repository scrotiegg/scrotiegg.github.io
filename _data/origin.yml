  - title: what is scrotiegg?
    text: |
      _Legend says Scrotiegg is the last known remnant of an ancient species: the **Scrotos Sapiens**._

      Originating from the lost planet of **Scrotara**, Scrotiegg belonged to a civilization destroyed by the very technology it created — a force so powerful and dangerous that its collapse gave rise to a new philosophy: **Scroticism**.

      **Scroticism** isn’t about chasing success.  
      It’s about embracing collapse with elegance, doubt with clarity, and failure with unshakable conviction.

      Some say the story is true.  
      Others claim it’s all nonsense — and Scrotiegg is just a cursed stock photo of a hairy egg found on Google at 3 a.m.

      _To discover the full story of Scrotiegg, read the prologue of the Book of Scroticism [here](#)._  <!-- substitua # pelo link real -->
