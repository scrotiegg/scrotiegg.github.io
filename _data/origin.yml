  - title: "what is scrotiegg?"
    text: |
      <center>legend says scrotiegg is the last known remnant of an ancient species: the scrotos sapiens.<br>
      originating from the lost planet of scrotara, scrotiegg belonged to a civilization destroyed by the very technology it created — a force so powerful and dangerous that its collapse gave rise to a new philosophy: scroticism.<br>

      scroticism isn’t about chasing success.<br>
      it’s about embracing collapse with elegance, doubt with clarity, and failure with unshakable conviction.<br>

      some say the story is true.<br>
      others claim it’s all nonsense — and scrotiegg is just a cursed stock photo of a hairy egg found on google at 3 a.m.<br>
      
      to discover the full story of scrotiegg, read the prologue of the book of scroticism here.</center>
