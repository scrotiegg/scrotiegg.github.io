  - title: what is scrotiegg?
    text: |
      _legend says scrotiegg is the last known remnant of an ancient species: the **scrotos sapiens**._

      originating from the lost planet of **scrotara**, scrotiegg belonged to a civilization destroyed by the very technology it created — a force so powerful and dangerous that its collapse gave rise to a new philosophy: **scroticism**.

      **scroticism** isn’t about chasing success.  
      it’s about embracing collapse with elegance, doubt with clarity, and failure with unshakable conviction.

      some say the story is true.  
      others claim it’s all nonsense — and scrotiegg is just a cursed stock photo of a hairy egg found on google at 3 a.m.

      _to discover the full story of scrotiegg, read the book of scroticism [here](/assets/pdf/thebookofscroticism(en).pdf)._
