      scrotiegg is an ancient creature from the fabled species scrotum sapiens—the long-lost link between humanity and glorious, stylish failure. legend says that eons ago, scrotiegg hatched from a hairy egg at the very center of the meme universe, bringing not just a questionable appearance, but also a groundbreaking philosophy: scroticism.

      scroticism isn’t about chasing success. it’s about embracing defeat with pride and irony. true followers know: “being born to lose is an art. losing with style is a privilege.” some say the spirit of scrotiegg still appears to those brave enough to ape into coins without reading the whitepaper, or to buy the top without a single regret.

      others say all of this is utter nonsense, and scrotiegg is, in fact, just a photo of a hairy egg someone found on google at 3 am.
