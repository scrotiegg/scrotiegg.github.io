      <center>scrotiegg exists to remind you that:<br>
      <b>you’ll probably fail.</b><br>
      <b>the market doesn’t care about you.</b><br>
      <b>luck is a skill you don’t have.</b><br>
      our goal is to give you exactly what you deserve: <b>nothing.</b><br>
      we won’t give you wings. we’ll give you a wrinkled, hairy egg to hold.</center>
