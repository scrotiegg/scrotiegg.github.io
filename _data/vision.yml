      the memecoin is just the marketing.   

      we know how humans work.  
      you crave profit — even when we swear there isn’t one.  
      no roadmap.  
      no whitepaper.  
      no future.  

      and still...  
      you’ll buy this thing.  

      maybe that’s the vision:  
      make you confront the joke you’re in.
