      scrotiegg exists to remind you that:
      • you’ll probably fail.
      • the market doesn’t care about you.
      • luck is a skill you don’t have.

      our goal is to give you exactly what you deserve: nothing.

      we won’t give you wings.
      we’ll give you a wrinkled, hairy sack to hold.
