      they say a bandâ€™s first album is their best.  
      so we decided to release our second album first.  
      
      13 tracks of pure disappointment, existential crises, and questionable beats.  
      
      if you thought rock bottom was low, wait till you hear this album.  

      out now on all major platforms.
