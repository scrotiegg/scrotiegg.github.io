      everyone says a band’s first album is their best.  
      which explains a lot about how things go downhill from the start.  
      so we decided to skip that part — and release our second album first.  
      
      13 tracks of pure disappointment, existential crises, and questionable beats.  
      
      out now on no major platforms.  
      
      if you thought rock bottom was low, wait till you hear this album.
