      they say a band’s first album is their best.  
      so we decided to release our second album first.  
      
      13 tracks of pure disappointment, existential crises, and questionable beats.  
      
      out now on no major platforms.  
      
      if you thought rock bottom was low, wait till you hear this album.  
      <a href="https://audius.co/scrotiegg/album/scrotiegg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">listen on audius</a> or on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@scrotiegg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">youtube channel</a>.  
      next, we released our third album, “echoes of scrotara,” as our second.
      it’s also on audius, unfortunately.
