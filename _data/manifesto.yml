    text: |
      motivation is just another lie from a self-help book.  
      you’ll probably fail.  
      the market doesn’t care about you.  
      luck is a skill you don’t have.  
      expect exactly what you deserve: nothing.  
      we won’t give you wings.  
      we’ll give you a wrinkled, hairy egg to hold.  

      welcome to the true community of losers.
