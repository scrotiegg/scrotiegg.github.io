      scrotiegg is for those who risk it all without thinking, lose without learning, and still raise their hands in the end.  
      a memecoin with no future, no promises, and no reason to exist—and that’s exactly why it does.  
      here, you accept your fate with style, and fail together as a true community of losers.

      still care about “roadmaps,” “utility,” or happy endings? you’re in the wrong place.  
      here, spectacular failure isn’t just expected—it’s the goal.  
      success is for the few. hope is for the naive. motivation is just another lie in a self-help book.

      scrotiegg promises you nothing—and delivers.
