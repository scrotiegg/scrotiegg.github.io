      let’s get straight to the point.  
      motivation is just another lie from a self-help book.  
      accept once and for all that:  
      **you’ll probably fail.**  
      **the market doesn’t care about you.**  
      **luck is a skill you don’t have.**  
      expect exactly what you deserve: **nothing.**  
      we won’t give you wings.  
      we’ll give you a **wrinkled, hairy egg to hold.**  

      welcome to the true community of losers.
